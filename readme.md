# Ford Go_Bike Sharing System Analysis for 2018
## by Lahsini Badr-Eddine


## Dataset

The data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area of the year of 2018. You can find this data set here : "https://s3.amazonaws.com/fordgobike-data/index.html".
The important attributes include the trip start/end time, as well as additional measurements such as duration and the distance of the trip, starting hour, day and month, user type and gender, and other variables that were not important to achieve our goal of explorations.


## Summary of Findings

Customers tend to use the bike for a long duration and travel long distance on average compared to Subscribers. And that's maybe because the subscribers tend to use the bike to commit daily tasks and not to take the bike as a tool of amusement only, opposed to casual customers that are more likely to use the bike as amusement and that is why the use of the bike by this group increases on weekends and summertime.

The count number of trips highly increases in summer time for both Subscribers and Casual Customers and for all member_gender. Because the number of Subscribers and Male are bigger than casual Customers and other gender respectively, it is normal that the number of dike trips will be higher for the first groups.

The number of bike trips for Subscribers tend to be very active during the working weekdays, especially at 8h am and 17h pm. On weekends the number dropped enormously for this group. However the average duration remains almost the same for Subscribers during the whole day, and that reminds us of our first idea that subscribers tend to use the bike to commit daily tasks (like going or returning from work). On the other side, the average distance traveled by Subscribers is at the top at 8h am, and register another increase at 17h pm. Besides the average duration remains almost the same for Subscribers during the whole week (with a tiny increase in the weekend), and that reminds us of our first idea that subscribers tend to use the bike to commit daily tasks (like going or returning from work). On the other side, the average distance traveled by Subscribers dropped in the weekend as we have seen before.







## Key Insights for Presentation

Since the number of trips tends to be higher at 8h am and 17h pm, I have plotted the shape by weekday to see if the number of trips have dropped at these times in the weekends, so that I can affirm the idea which suggest that Subscribers are using the bike as a transport tools to commit daily tasks, like going to work or college, etc. And the results were as expected, and it strengthens our idea.s
